This natural ordering for Shape is bad because:

1. It tells us nothing about an object other than the area when comparing to other object. No information about the object type or perimeter can be inferred from the comparison. 

2. This ordering assumes that 2 objects are the same order if they have the same area, which contradicts the equals() method.
